Lampify 1.0.0 by MasterDevX
Made in Ukraine

Usage:
lampify <mode> <action> [parameter]

Available modes:
q               quiet (without notifications)
v               verbose (with notifications)

Available actions:
setup           connect to the lamp

cold  <0..9>    set cold brightness
warm  <0..9>    set warm brightness
dual  <0..9>    set dual brightness

```

### Initial setup
Before you can control your lamp, you have to perform an initial setup so the lamp will remember the unique ID of your device generated by lampify. The ID is being generated based on your machine's hostname.

To perform the initial setup:
- Turn the lamp on using the power switch
- Within a few seconds after powering the lamp on, send a setup signal from your device:

  ```
  lampify q setup
  ```
- If you see the lamp flashing, the connection is established

### Command examples
Turn the lamp on (without notification):
```
lampify q on
```

Turn the lamp off (with notification):
```
lampify v off
```

Set warm temperature and brightness to 5 (without notification):
```
lampify q warm 5
```

Set cold temperature and brightness to 2 (with notification):
```
lampify v cold 2
```
